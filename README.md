# Password-Server-Simulator
An assignment where I had to write my own version of the Hashtable STL container, use it to write a class for hosting a password server, and then write a program using my password server class to read, encrypt, and write files containing a list of usernames and passwords. Also included is a makefile to make compiling the project a little easier.
